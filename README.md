VirtacoinPlus is a hybrid PoW/PoS cryptocurrency.
---------------------------------------------

NOTE:
------

9,000,000 Virtacoinplus was premined and used to swap Virtacoin (VTA) for Virtacoinplus (XVP) at a 1:1000 ratio. Great care was taken to make sure no single person would own more than 1% of initial XVP distribution.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the VirtacoinPlus
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions or are controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/VirtacoinPlus/VirtacoinPlus/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of VirtacoinPlus.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
